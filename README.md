- This program reads a document and allows user to press 1-9 on their number pad to send an element to the cursor.
- File can be read as a CSV, line by line, or with a custom delimiter. 
- A display shows what will be sent when the user presses a number
- Documents that contain more than 9 elements can be cycled through using zero and dot (.) from the number pad
- User can adjust how much zero or dot increments the program using ctrl + zero/dot
  - A "Shift" section next to the increment amount can be used to move around document instead of the hotkeys
- For large documents, user can 'jump to' an element
- While the mouse is hovering over these controls (including the font size), the mouse wheel can be used
- Previews are provided to peek ahead/behind the current position
- 'Empty' elements of a document are replaced by a default string which the user can change
- A status bar indicates which file is currently being read, where in the document the program is, and some useful hotkeys.
- A section is provided to show other documents contained in the current parent folder
  - User can use Numpad + (+/-) to navigate the current directory
- There are some features for users who have become acustomed to the program
  - Ctrl+(+/-) adjust the window's transparency
  - Shift+(+/-) adjust the text's darkness
    - Ctrl+Shift+(+/-) adjust both of these at the same time
  - The window can be shrunk to only show what is loaded to the number pad with Ctrl+h
- To disable the program so the number pad can be used regularly, press the * (multiply) key

# Known Issues
- This uses the clipboard to send the elements, so pressing keys too fast may result in unintended behavior
  
# TO DO
- Change how text is sent to avoid the rapid pressing issue
- The "> " file indicator sometimes doesn't get cleared properly
- Have this be tested on different systems
- Replicate mouse wheel controls for shift section to other sections
